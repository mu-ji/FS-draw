This project allow user using Fourier Series(FS) to draw any pattern.

draw_trajectory.py used for drawing any pattern in a window and save the trajectory into trajectory.txt.

After draw a trajectory, gererate_fs.py will using FS to draw the pattern. By changing the value of variable num_circle, can adjust the precision of the drawing.
